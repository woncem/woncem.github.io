        <p>There is a new update that most people over 65 don't know about. If more people took advantage of this update, the division would pay out millions of dollars in rightful rebates and evaluations.</p><br>

        <p>Recent changes across all 50 U.S. states indicate that anyone over 65 and living in a qualified zipcode may qualify for one of the highest medicare rebates the nation has seen in the last 12 years. If you have not made a claim in the last 3 years, you may get an even larger rebate due to the new medicare update that has been passed.</p><br>

        <p><strong>This offer is set to expire soon. There is no cost & no obligation to see if you qualify for these medicare rebates.</strong></p><br>

        <h3><strong>Has Your Local Liaison Officer Bothered To Tell You About This?</strong></h3>

        <p>Jennifer wasn't aware of this update.</p><br>

        <p>She needed to <strong>save some money</strong> on bills after her and her husband retired from the post office. Her old boss was always great with money so she reached out for advice.</p><br>

        <p>He looked over her bills and saw <strong>she was paying triple</strong> what he paid for his medicare bills despite the fact that her pension income was much smaller than his. He told her she needed to fix this ASAP.</p><br>

        <p>Her husband Steve usually handled all the bills but he had the flu and was in no shape to call anyone. So Jennifer was forced to do her own research.</p><br>

        <p>Jennifer entered her zip code at <a href="https://ahonav.club/one/"><strong><u>Medicare Rebates</u></strong></a> and was amazed at the total amount she was entitled to.</p><br>

              <p><strong>“I Received a 4 Figure Rebate Due To The New Rule. I Only Wish I Found Out About This Rule Sooner.”</strong>
              <p><strong>– Jennifer </strong></p>

        <p>When anyone go to <a href="https://ahonav.club/one/"><strong><u>trusted sites</u></strong></a> they get an unbiased view of the new medicare updates in their area that INCLUDE any and all new updates implemented by the local liaison division. Current data shows you could claim an additional 4 figures or more a year on medicare rebates.</p><br>

        <p>Here is the lesson to learn – ALWAYS contact your local liaison officer to ensure that that you are well informed on medicare updates.</p>
